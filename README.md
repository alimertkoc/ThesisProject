# ThesisProject
A Web Crawler Project for my thesis.


# getAllLinks.py
- This file handles getting car urls from web. Returns a csv file which is includes list of car urls.

# scrapeCarInfos.py
- This file takes the output from 'getAllLinks.py' and sends request to each url in the csv.
- With results of requests, we get car informations and we are starting to create our dataset.
